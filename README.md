# Advent of Code 2018

This is repository for my solutions for Advent of Code 2018 programming puzzles (https://adventofcode.com/2018/about).

First 12 puzzles are done with JavaScript/NodeJS (v10.8.0). They can be run with node by running `node dayX.js`, where X is in range [1,12].

Puzzles 13 - 25 are done with TypeScript/NodeJS. If ts-node is installed globally, they can be run with `ts-node dayX.ts`, where X is in range [13,25]. Alternatively ts-node can be installed locally with `npm install` and used with `npx ts-node dayX.ts`.
